Executable binaries (often simply referred to as "binaries") are files that the operating system can run directly as a program. In the context of software and programming:

Source Code: This is the human-readable code that developers write using programming languages like C, Python, Java, etc.

Compilation: For languages like C or C++, the source code is then converted into machine code by a compiler. This process turns the human-readable code into a format that a computer's CPU can understand and execute directly.

Binary (or Executable): The output of the compilation process is an executable binary. This file contains machine code and can be run directly by the operating system.

For example, on a Windows system, typical binary executables have a .exe extension, on macOS, they might have .app, and on Linux, they often have no extension at all.

In the Context of Node.js and npm:
When we talk about binaries in the Node.js or npm ecosystem, we're typically referring to executable scripts that come with some npm packages. These aren't always "binaries" in the traditional sense (i.e., compiled machine code). Instead, they might be JavaScript files that are meant to be run with Node.js or even shell scripts. They are "executable" because they have been set up to be run as commands from the command line.

For example, many npm packages include command-line tools that you can use once the package is installed. These tools are made available as "binaries" in the node_modules/.bin/ directory.

Here's how it usually works:

An npm package wants to provide a command-line tool, let's call it mytool.
The package includes an executable file, which might be a JavaScript file written to be run by Node.js.
In the package's package.json file, there's a bin field that specifies that mytool should run the provided executable file.
When you install the package, npm sets things up so you can run mytool from the command line.
Usage:
Using npm, if you install a package globally (with -g), any binaries it provides are linked in a global bin directory (like /usr/local/bin on many systems) and can be run from anywhere. If you install the package locally (the default), the binaries end up in node_modules/.bin/, and you can run them using a path like ./node_modules/.bin/mytool, or more conveniently using npx mytool if you have npx installed.
